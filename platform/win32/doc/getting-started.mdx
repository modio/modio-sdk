## mod.io Windows SDK Integration

The use of Windows with the mod.io SDK is ready by default. You can find the `windows` directory in the platform subdirectory of your SDK installation.
You can then target `WIN` to compile the mod.io SDK for Windows.

## Windows Terminal Compilation of x64 library

When you compile the mod.io SDK and you require a x64 library in Windows, confirm the use the "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2019", which by default employs the x64 compiler. To verify the Static or Shared library was compiled with x64 architecture, you can use the "dumpbin" command:
```
dumpbin out\build\win\modio\modioStatic.lib /headers
```
Then search for the confirmation as follows:
```
Dump of file out\build\win\modio\modioStatic.lib
