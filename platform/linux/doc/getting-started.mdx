# Linux Setup

## mod.io Linux SDK integration

The use of Linux with the mod.io SDK is ready by default. You can find the `linux` directory in the platform subdirectory of your SDK installation.
You can then target `LINUX` to compile the mod.io SDK for Linux SDK.

:::important[Find your guide]
This setup guide is intended for those building for Linux. If that's not you, check out our other [Platform Installation Guides](/cppsdk/installation/#platform-installation-guides) or continue to work through the [C++ SDK Getting Started Guides](/cppsdk/#getting-started) to implement mod.io's core functionality.

## Linux SDK versions

The mod.io SDK is built and tested against Ubuntu 21.04 using clang v10. Using different versions of the Linux SDK may result in compilation issues.

In Linux, the default way to compile the mod.io SDK requires CMake with Ninja as generator, which you can install CMake Installation instructions or using a package manager like `apt`:

```cmake
sudo apt install cmake ninja
```

## Dependencies

The mod.io SDK requires a Linux kernel with liburing support (v5.1 or later). The io_uring system calls provides asynchronous input/output operations. To fulfill that requirement and have the development tools ready, the following commands employ the "apt" package manager (tested on Ubuntu 20.04 Focal Fossa):

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install llvm clang lldb make wget python3 ninja-build git unzip
## Install Cmake
wget -q -O cmake-linux.sh https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.21.3/cmake-3.21.3-Linux-x86_64.sh
sh cmake-linux.sh -- --skip-license --prefix=/usr/
## Install liburing-dev
wget http://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu/pool/main/libu/liburing/liburing-dev_0.7-3ubuntu3_amd64.deb
wget http://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu/pool/main/libu/liburing/liburing1_0.7-3ubuntu3_amd64.deb
sudo apt install ./liburing*deb
```

The mod.io SDK also requires libuuid, which is available in the standard `uuid-dev` package, e.g.

```bash 
sudo apt install uuid-dev
```

:::note
If you are using the "header_only" release mode, the mod.io SDK includes MbedTLS headers, but requires the library installed in your system, which was tested with libmbedtls-dev 2.28.0 in Ubuntu. The "static" mode includes these libraries in the same folder as the libmodioStatic.a
